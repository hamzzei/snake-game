# snake-game

This JavaScript game was originally built following a series of lessons on Scrimba, however this version of the app was created from scratch by myself, with extra features added.

The extra features include each new apple that gets added to the pages being assigned a random colour rather than them all being the same, as well as the 'Hi Score' functionality at the top of the page which takes advantage of the user's localStorage in their browser.
